# EEG_waves
The project is on "Analyzing NeuroSky EEG data for the video game study". We get EEG waves data from different subjects playing games like "Unreal Tournament" and "Angry Birds" and while watching boring videos. The data is obtained from the NeuroSky Mind wave mobile. We get the Power Spectrum of the data. After the preprocessing part we will extract the features from the data and will classfy data into different waves i.e. alpha, beta, gamma ..etc.

## Getting Started 

You can get the code by cloning it or directly download the zip file. I have included the basic code here and some part of the code is not present due to permission issues from Professor. If you want the full code you can drop me a mail at rishabh05@iitkgp.ac.in .

### Prerequisites

The code is written on MATLAB 2016a.
